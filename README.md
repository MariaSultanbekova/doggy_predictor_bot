Hi!
Last time, I told you how I trained a neural network to recognize dog breeds.
And later I came up with the idea to make a chat bot using this network.

In this folder there is a code for training the model with subsequent downloading of weights and a code where I implement the telegram bot itself

Code:

- Train https://github.com/MariaSultanbekova/telegram_bot_with_AI/blob/main/dogs_classification_train.ipynb
- Production https://github.com/MariaSultanbekova/telegram_bot_with_AI/blob/main/main.py
